# Free Face Mask Creator

**WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET COMPLETE. SOME THINGS DO NOT WORK YET.**

Website: https://freefacemaskcreator.com

This is a free and open-source embeddable website that lets users
add an image to a face mask and print out the pattern so they can
sew their own personalized custom face mask.

## Why does this project exist?

Face masks are [incredibly effective](https://www.livescience.com/face-masks-eye-protection-covid-19-prevention.html)
at stopping the spread of Covid-19, but many people hesitate to
wear them because they feel uncomfortable or think they look silly.

The goal of this project is to reduce the stigma of wearing a face
mask by encouraging you get creative and create your own one-of-a-kind
facemask.
